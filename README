PREREQUISITES:

Perl 5 (as far as I know that's it.)

INSTALLATION:

Sorry, no makefile. Just install the directory the file MethodMaker.pm
under the directory Class somewhere in your @INC.

TODO:

o Autoload the meta-methods so we don't have to compile the whole
  MethodMaker just to get a few meta-methods we actually use.

o I may think about changing the way the meta-methods are called. I'll
  try to maintain backwards compatibility (I've certainly got more code
  than anyone else on the planet that would break if I pooch backwards
  compatibility ;-) but no promises at this point.

VERSION:
